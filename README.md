Push Swap :
===========

Project Description
-------------------

Push Swap is a program that sorts a stack of numbers in ascending order using a set of predefined operations.

Requirements
------------

* Global variables are forbidden.
* You have to write a program named `push_swap` that takes as an argument the stack `a` formatted as a list of integers, with the first argument at the top of the stack.
* The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack `a`, with the smallest number at the top.
* In case of error, the program must display "Error" followed by a newline character on the standard error. Errors include, for example, arguments that are not integers, arguments that exceed the integer limit, and duplicates.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  Read a lot about sort because this is an important point as a dev (most of the technical test interview will ask you to code a sorting algorithm).
2.  The program isn't really interesting because forcing specific operation might not be the best way to learn about sorting.
3.  Make sure not to manually sort lists of 5 because this isn't authorized in the correction.
