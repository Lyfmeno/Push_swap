  <h1>Push Swap :</a></h1>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>Push Swap is a program that sorts a stack of numbers in ascending order using a set of predefined operations.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Global variables are forbidden.</li>
    <li>You have to write a program named <code>push_swap</code> that takes as an argument the stack <code>a</code> formatted as a list of integers, with the first argument at the top of the stack.</li>
    <li>The program must display the smallest list of instructions possible to sort the stack <code>a</code>, with the smallest number at the top.</li>
    <li>In case of error, the program must display "Error" followed by a newline character on the standard error. Errors include, for example, arguments that are not integers, arguments that exceed the integer limit, and duplicates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Read a lot about sort because this is an important point as a dev (most of the technical test interview will ask you to code a sorting algorithm).</li>
    <li>The program isn't really interesting because forcing specific operation might not be the best way to learn about sorting.</li>
    <li>Make sure not to manually sort lists of 5 because this isn't authorized in the correction.</li>
  </ol>
